what are the math symbols we are dealing with 

+ - * / ^

number
Paran expression

power
unary number
mul/div
plus/minus

unaryNumber
()

3^3 + 5
27 + 5
3 ^ (3 + 5)
-3^3 +5

^

number < atom
number mathsymbol number (*/) > term 3 *3 4/4 > atom (*/ atom)
+- > expr

3 * 5 + 6 /7
((3 *5) + (6 /7)) > expr > term (+/ term)*

3 = atom
-3 = +-(atom)

-(3 + 3) -(expr)
3 * (5 + 6) /7 - (expr)

power ^
3 ^ 7
(3 / 7)^(3 *9)
3^ 3 + 7 , first power
3 + 3 ^ 3 + 7

-3^3 > -(3^3) = -27
(-3)^3

number - atom
expression - atom
power
Unary - factor
term -
expr

3 ^(-3, (expr), number)

VAR a = 10
VAR = KEYWORD
a = IDENTIFIER
'=' = EQUAL

var a = 5
var b = 5 * 5
RHS should take priority than LHS from perspective of =
variable_name given seperately < atom

var a = var b = var c =11
5 + (var x = 9)

Why r we changing the err? what's the purpose of register_advancements?
What situation in error should be avoided?
5 + (VAR a = 11) < this gets executed
5 + VAR a = 11 < but this doesn't < and the error given for this is "missing number or parnthesis expr or variable name" < so in this situation error msg should be overriden 

VAR X = 3==3 : VAR X =(3 == 3) < priority should be given to solving logical operation then variable assignment
5 + 3 <= 3 +9 : (5 + 3) <= (3 + 9) < priority should be given to solving LHS and RHS expressions then logical expression
same is true for AND OR NOTEQ operators

Priority of logical operators is more than Var assignment but less than solving math expressions

expr				: KEYWORD:VAR IDENTIFIER EQ expr
						: comp-expr ((KEYWORD:AND|KEYWORD:OR) comp-expr)*

comp-expr		: NOT comp-expr
						: arith-expr ((EE|LT|GT|LTE|GTE) arith-expr)*

arith-expr	:	term ((PLUS|MINUS) term)*

term				: factor ((MUL|DIV) factor)*

factor			: (PLUS|MINUS) factor
						: power

power				: atom (POW factor)*

atom 				: INT|FLOAT|IDENTIFIER
						: LPAREN expr RPAREN

comparision operators 
<, <=, >, >=, !=

3^3 < -4 ^1 
3 *3 < -4 /1

VAR X = 3 < 4
comparision takes less priority than atom, power, factor, term, term(PLUS/MINU)term
but 
takes more priorty than VAR assignmet

logical operators
AND OR NOT

NOT 5 < 2
logical operators taks less priority than comparision operators

VAR X = NOT 5 < 2
logical oper takes more priorty than VAR assignment

after NOT, it has to be arith_expr
NOT +!= < error
NOT (comp_expr)

AND, OR
(comp_expr) AND/OR (comp_expr)

# targetted if statement 

VAR age = 50
VAR something = if age >= 81 then 'old' else 'young'
VAR something = 'old' if age >=81 else 'young'
