PARSER

if expression are like 

5 + 5 == 2 + 8
 result should be (5 + 5) == (2 + 8), not 5 + (5 == 2) + 8
for above comparision operator, priority should be given to LHS and RHS expressions 
rather than the middle operator

if we have a VAR assignment like
VAR = 5 == 5, priority should be comparision expression like VAR = (5 == 5)
rather than variable assignment (VAR = 5) == 5

if we have logical operators along with comparision exressions like 
5 == 5 AND 6 == 6
priority should be given to comparision operation not logical (5 == 5) AND (6 == 6)
not to logical 5 == (5 AND  6) == 6

for not 
NOT 1== 2 it will be NOT (1 == 2)
